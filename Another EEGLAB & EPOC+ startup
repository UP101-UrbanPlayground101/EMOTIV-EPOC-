Not an application developer,
I am a Psychology grad student configuring EPOC+ in my practioner work of research and consultation 
In order for me practricing my work appropriately, EEG understandings, patterns, and frameworks,
are important for interpreting;
therefore, I'm putting 8 years of professional study,
20 years of personal study and technological tinkering into where I'm at right now
Trying to program an application with my EEG scanner so that I can see brainwaves, chimichanga!
Currently trying to communicate EEG logic constructs with data
